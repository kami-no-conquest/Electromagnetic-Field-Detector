# Electromagnetic Field Detector Using Arduino

## Overview
This is a simple project that detects the strengths of electromagnetic signals and displays it on a number of LEDs carried out majorly to test a bunch of newly procured electrical components.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno or other clone board.
- copper strip.
- Resistors.
- LEDs.
- Breadboard and connecting wires.
- Power source (e.g., batteries).
